# This readme file consists of the the website's link, Repository Link, OmniDimension Script Tag, Google Spreadsheet Link.

## Note: As the google form only had one field to upload the link and my project had videos, images as well as website links along with github link, hence I though of creating a comming readme that will include every singel stuff. Below are the important links and the videos as well the images will be stored in their seperate folders.

### 1. Link to the website: https://sneakerscout.vercel.app/
### 2. Link to the website's repository: https://github.com/mishrayush15/sneakerscout
### 3. OmniDimension Script tag: 
```javascript
<script id="omnidimension-web-widget" async src="https://backend.omnidim.io/web_widget.js?secret_key=afea15dbeecd082cd9434db2eff06c81" ></script>
```
### 4. Link to spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ShLYZPW-q4vUyvN-6Jf_WHWB6Wx0E22O22b2fbAYa5k/edit?usp=sharing

## Important Note: I was not able to capture my device's audio that's why the ai agent's audio is not audible in the video. Apart from this I have also attached the Email images that I received from the the agent and also I have succesfully integrated the Google Spreadsheet feature that stores the data as said in the requirements of hackathon project.
